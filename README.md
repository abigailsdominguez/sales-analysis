Data analysis with Python and Tableau using Supermarket Sales sample data 

Using Python (jupyter notebook), I tried to answer the following questions:
- Q1: Which branch had the highest sales?
- Q2: Which product line had the most sales?
- Q3: Which month had the highest sales?
- Q4: What was the highest selling product line per gender?
- Q5: What is the highest rated product line?
